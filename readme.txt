Flashcard Snap
This is a project for language learning that combines flashcards with a game
of snap to gamify the learning experience. The reasoning behind using this 
instead of regular flashcards is that giving someone a task to complete helps
to keep them more engaged.

Due to the small scale of the project, Flask is used for the backend and csv
files are used to store data locally. Javascript is used for the frontend.

I'm using this as a means to learn Javascript and may in future decide to 
switch over to using Node.js and React.

Currently, the project is a work in progress (especially the practice page)
